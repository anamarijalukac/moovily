The goal of this application is to enable registered users to keep records of previously watched films and those they plan to watch in the future. Probably the most important feature is to help these users find movies similar to the ones they have in their wishlist in the hopes that they will like these suggested movies as well. The application can also be used by unregistered users, but since they do not have their own profiles within the same, they will not be able to use the functionality related to movie logs, as well as the full system of recommendations. Unregistered users thus have the option of viewing currently popular movies and can search for movies by name. Detailed film information and a list of similar films are available for each film.
